# Fighting Actions Predictor

## In this project I used several videos and recordings of myself to create a classifier that detects and predicts martial art moves

# Intro
For those of you who haven’t fought too many times, learning your opponent is crucial. If you do it well you are almost sure to win. 
If you do it wrong though, you might find yourself on the ground faster than you can type print(‘Hello World’).
In this project I used a Convolutional Neural Network model that can detect fighting moves and later predict them.  
The [Fighting_Actions_Predictor.ipynb](Fighting_Actions_Predictor.ipynb) file shows my process.   
Note: I have used Google Colab server to increase performance on this project.
